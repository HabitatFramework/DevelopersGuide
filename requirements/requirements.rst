Software developers will come from different backgrounds, have different skills and experience and may use different development environments and tools. Whilst one developer may prefer to have formal training and extensive experience in one particular programming language or concept before tackling a task, another developer may be comfortable to use their experience in other languages or platforms to pick things up as they go. Hence it is not possible to come up with a definitive list of all the skills, experience and tools that a developer **must** have or use in order to undertake development and support of the HLU Tool. Therefore the following is just a guide to the applications, websites and tools that a developer may use and the skills & experience that a developer **may** need.


Applications
============

The following is a list of applications that you are likely to need as a minimum to develop and support the HLU Tool:

	* Microsoft Visual Studio Professional 2012 (or later)
	* Microsoft .Net Framework 3.5 (or higher)
	* ArcGIS 10.1 (or later)
	* MapInfo 8 (or later)
	* SQL Server Express 2008 (or later)
	* Microsoft Access 2000 (or later)
	* Git for Windows
	* GitHub for Windows
	* InstallShield Limited Edition


Websites
========

The following is a list of websites that you will need to use and become familiar with when developing and supporting the HLU Tool and associated user, technical and developer's guides:

	* `GitHub repository <https://github.com/HabitatFramework>`_ : Hosts the source code for the tool and accompanying user and technical guides (including this developer's guide), and is also used as the `issue tracker <https://github.com/HabitatFramework/HLUTool/issues>`_ for any agreed known issues and proposed change requests for the tool.

	.. seealso::
		See :ref:`source_control_github` and :ref:`issue_tracking` for more details.

	* `ReadTheDocs online guides <https://readthedocs.org/>`_ : Creates and hosts the `User Guide <https://readthedocs.org/projects/hlugistool-userguide/>`_, `Technical Guide <https://readthedocs.org/builds/hlutool-technicalguide/>`_ and `Developer's Guide <https://readthedocs.org/projects/hlutool-developersguide/>`_ (this guide) for the tool. See :ref:`documentation_rtd` for more details.
