ALERC Forum
===========

The `ALERC forum <http://forum.lrcs.org.uk/viewforum.php?id=24>`_ is available for open discussions by users about the tool. Users should post items on the forum in the following situations:

	* When they experience any new issues unrelated to *testing* a specific release of the tool.
	* If they want to recommend any new changes or enhancements to the tool.
	* If have any general queries relating to the use or functionality of the tool.

Posting new issues and proposed enhancements to the tool on the forum allows all users to consider and discuss the proposal. Once a consensus has been reached on a change or solution to an issue it can be added to the HLUTool issues log on GitHub (see :Ref:`issue_tracking`_). It can then be prioritised and scheduled to be addressed when time and funding allows.

The ALERC forum is not intended for use during any scheduled development or maintenance phases. This is because planned changes or fixes are easier to find and track using the GitHub issues log.

GitHub Issue Tracker
====================

The GitHub `HLUTool issues log <https://github.com/HabitatFramework/HLUTool/issues>`_ is where agreed changes and fixes to the tool should be logged. Once time and funding allows they can then be prioritised and scheduled within an upcoming project. They can then be assigned to a project milestone (and if necessary a specific developer).

Once the project is under way the issues log should be used in the following situations:

	* If users have any queries about a planned change or fix scheduled to be addressed in an upcoming release of the tool.
	* If users experience any problems testing any of the changes or fixes addressed in a new release of the tool.
	* If users have successfully tested a scheduled change or fix.

Queries, problems and test results should all be added as comments to the relevant change/fix in the issues log. Users will have to register on GitHub and log in to be able to post comments.
