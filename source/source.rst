GitHub
======

The HLU Tool source code is hosted by GitHub in the `HLUTool repository <https://github.com/HabitatFramework/HLUTool>`_. GitHub is a well known web-based hosting service for software development projects. GitHub uses the **Git** Version Control System (VCS) which, like all version control systems, records changes to a file or set of files over time so that specific versions can be recalled later.

If you are signed in to GitHub you can **Fork** the repository to create your own local copy, or alternatively you can download a Zip copy of all the source files.

Branches
--------

There are two `branches <https://github.com/HabitatFramework/HLUTool/branches>`_ in the HLUTool repository:

	* **master** : contains the source code for the ArcGIS/MapInfo variant of the tool
	* **master-mapinfo** : contains the source code for the MapInfo only variant of the tool


Commits

Tags
----

The source code for every version of the tool from v1.0.1 to v1.0.8 is stored on GitHub. Each version of the source code is **Tagged** with the version number listed under `tags <https://github.com/HabitatFramework/HLUTool/tags>`_.

	* tags **'v1.0.1'** thru **'v1.0.8'** denote versions relating to the ArcGIS/MapInfo variant *master* branch
	* tags **'v1.0.1m'** thru **'v1.0.8m'** denote versions relating to the MapInfo only variant *master-mapinfo* branch.


Releases
--------

In addition to the source code **tags**, each variant/version of the tool is listed under `releases <https://github.com/HabitatFramework/HLUTool/releases>`_. Each release contains a set of **Release Notes** together with a download link to a Zip copy of the source code and the Windows Installer **setup.exe** program for that version.
